First, I collected historic Apple data from sec.gov, and entered it into an Excel spreadsheet. 

After uploading the spreadsheet into RStudio database, I then separated the data into a dataframe containing only the variables I was interested in working with. 

From here, I utilized a resampling method, with simulations set at 1000. After the 1000 samples were obtained, I then found the mean of all samples for each variable I was interesed in. 

In general, the more historic data one collects, the more accurate the prediction. 

This method was used to determine future sales/demand of each Apple product, then calculate the profit after summing the product and subtracting the cost to manufacture. 
```{r}
AAPL = read.csv("/Users/kris/Documents/AAPLHistoric.csv")
head(AAPL)
AAPL <- AAPL[,-c(21, 22)]
AAPL <- AAPL[,c(10:13)]

num_sim =1000
set.seed(123)
iPhone <- AAPL[,1]
iPhone <- sample(iPhone, num_sim, replace=TRUE)
siPhone <- mean(iPhone)

set.seed(123)
Mac <- AAPL[,2]
Mac <- sample(Mac, num_sim, replace=TRUE)
sMac <- mean(Mac)

set.seed(123)
iPad <- AAPL[,3]
iPad <- sample(iPad, num_sim, replace=TRUE)
siPad <- mean(iPad)



siPhone # 91010527
sMac # 12666657
siPad # 26320812


TotalUnitSales <- siPhone+sMac+siPad
TotalUnitSales # 129997996

PriceiPhone =757.33275 
NetiPhoneSales = siPhone * PriceiPhone
NetiPhoneSales # 68925252692

PriceMac = 1383.821
NetMacSales = PriceMac * sMac
NetMacSales # 17528385956

PriceiPad = 422.1890 
NetiPadSales = PriceiPad * siPad
NetiPadSales # 11112357297

TotalProductSales = NetiPhoneSales + NetMacSales + NetiPadSales
TotalProductSales # 9.7566e+10

# BETTER PREDICTIONS W/ MORE DATA

# We can also implement a profit function, instead of the detailed description above. 
netProfitFun = function(D, Q, R, C) {
  R*min(D,Q) - C*min(D,Q)
}

# Could be used with any purchasing data (clothing, etc.) to see what customers are pairing. 

```{r}
library(arules)
data(Groceries)

apriori(Groceries)
summary(Groceries)

# explore the data
dim(Groceries) #9835 transactions/rows, 169 items/columns
str(Groceries) # review datatypes
size(Groceries) 
length(Groceries)

# Inspect the first few recordsE:
inspect(Groceries[1:3])

# Let's set to products purchased at least twice a day/60 times a month or whichever frequency you'd find interesting:
# min support level is set by dividing the 60 by however many transactions you have in the data set (in this case, its 60/9835 = .006)

# Confidence level is the percent of time the rule has to be correct. In this case, I will randomly set it at 0.25. The rule will need to be correct at least 25% of the time. (would increase this for business case)

myRules <- apriori(Groceries, parameter = list(support = 0.006, confidence = 0.25, minlen = 2))

# Review how many rules were met:
summary(myRules) # 463

# Inspect first 3 rules from above function:
inspect(myRules[1:3])

# Inspect all rules:
inspect(myRules)

# A high lift usually means the rules is important
inspect(sort(myRules, by = "lift")[1:5]) # sorting by lift and only first top 5 rules with the highest lift

# Find rules that include berries:
berryRules <- subset(myRules, items %in% "berries")
inspect(berryRules)


# Find tules that include berries an dyogurt:
berryRules <- subset(myRules, items %in% c("berries", "yogurt"))
inspect(berryRules)

#Partial matching with pin (like citrus fruit and tropical fruit)
fruitRules <- subset(myRules, items %pin% "fruit")
inspect(fruitRules)

# Increase confidence level to 90% and update rules to maxlen 3:
myRules2 <- apriori(Groceries, parameter = list(support = 0.001, confidence = 0.9, maxlen = 4))
myRules2 # 67 rules created with new requirements
